# Point system

## How points works in our app

In the Gayaan App, the point system is designed to allow users to make connections and utilize certain features within the app. Here's how the point system works:

**Free Daily Points:**

Every user receives 50 free points every 24 hours. These points are provided to users without any cost.


**Points for Direct Connect:**

The primary use of points in your app is for the "Direct Connect" feature.
Initiating a "Direct Connect" with another user ``costs 50 points``.
This means that within a 24-hour period, a user can use their free 50 points to connect with one other user via "Direct Connect."


Here's a step-by-step explanation of how this works:

1. User A receives 50 free points for the day.
2. User A decides to use their points to initiate a "Direct Connect" with User B.
3. User A's point balance is reduced to 0 (they have used all their daily points).
4. User B receives message from use A.


After this interaction, both User A and User B have connected via "Direct Connect," and they can communicate with each other without any additional point cost within the app. However, User A will need to wait until the next day to receive another 50 free points if they wish to use the "Direct Connect" feature again.

This feature not only facilitates connections while controlling the frequency of 'Direct Connect' interactions through the daily allocation of free points but also serves as an incentive for users to return to the app regularly, which may encourage them to consider purchasing additional points.

:::note
The free 50 points expire after 24 hours if they are not used. Active hours start from midnight 12:00AM and ends at 11:59PM.
