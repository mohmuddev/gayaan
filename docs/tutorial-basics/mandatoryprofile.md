:::note

Not all photos are uploaded; a photo should include a visible face structure, and if girls are wearing a hijab, it's acceptable as long as their eyes and other facial features are still visible. I need the app to detect face structure.

:::  

:::tip

Certainly, you can use Google's ML Kit for Firebase, which is a suite of machine learning tools provided by Google for mobile and web app development. ML Kit offers a ready-made face detection feature that can be used to detect faces in photos, including cases where individuals are wearing head coverings like hijabs
