# Matching Algorithm

## Matching Algorithm

When a user like `Ali` signs up on the Gayaan App, a comprehensive matching algorithm comes into play to facilitate the connection of Somali marriage seekers. The algorithm takes into account various aspects of user profiles to provide personalized and relevant matches.

**1. User Profile Collection:**

During the sign-up process, users are prompted to provide critical information that enhances the matching process. This includes their full name, gender, date of birth, marital status, education, profession, a brief bio, and a photo. While these are the primary pieces of information, users have the flexibility to complete their profiles later on.


**3. Matching Criteria:**

The algorithm, at its core, centers on location and user preferences as key criteria for matchmaking. It systematically explores potential matches based on the following principles:

**Priority 1:** The highest priority is assigned to users in the same city who share shared similarities, thereby fostering connections built on commonalities and interests.

**Priority 2:** In the absence of direct matches with shared similarities, the algorithm continues to consider users in the same city, recognizing the significance of geographic proximity.

**Priority 3:** If the local search doesn't yield results, The algorithm broadens its scope to include users within the same country, emphasizing proximity as a key factor in potential compatibility while still focusing on nearby locations.

**Priority 4:** If no suitable matches are found in the user's country or nearby areas, the algorithm widens its search to include potential matches from around the world while still paying attention to users in nearby locations. This ensures that users have the opportunity to connect with people globally while keeping an eye on those who are closer in proximity.

**Summary**
In essence, the Gayaan App's matching algorithm prioritizes location and user preferences, initially focusing on local matches with shared commonalities or proximity, and expanding to country and worldwide searches if necessary. This systematic approach ensures that users can discover potential partners both nearby and from around the world, fostering meaningful connections tailored to their preferences and locations.


## Closing matches and consideration

When a user dismisses a profile:
  - The app archives the dismissed profiles, making them accessible in the "Dismissed" tab within 
    the Explore page for a duration of 15 days. After this period, they are permanently removed from the list.
      
If a user who was previously dismissed updates their profile information:
  -  The algorithm automatically reverts the profile back to the matching pool, ensuring that users 
     have the opportunity to reconsider their connection choices based on the updated information.
