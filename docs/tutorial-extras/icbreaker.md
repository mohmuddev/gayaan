# Icebreaker ðŸ”—

## How users connect first time.

Gayaan Users can connect for the first time in two ways:
- Matual like (Free)
- Direct Connect (50 points/connect or Unlimited via premium plan)

### Matual Like
A "Mutual Like" feature in the Gayaan app is a way to facilitate connections between users who have expressed mutual interest or attraction in each other's profiles. This feature typically works as follows:

**User Interaction:**

- Users browse through profiles of potential matches on the app.
- When a user comes across a profile they are interested in, they can initiate a "Like" or "Interest" action on that profile.


**Mutual Like Recognition:**

- If both users mutually like each other's profiles (i.e., both users have liked each other), the app recognizes this as a `Mutual Like` or Match.


**Notification:**

Both users receive a notification or alert indicating that they have a "Mutual Like" or Match with each other.
The notification typically includes a message that informs them of the match and encourages them to start a conversation.


**Chat Initiation:**

- Users can now initiate a conversation with their mutual match through the app's messaging or chat feature.
- This allows them to get to know each other better and potentially explore the possibility of a connection or relationship.

The `Matual like` option is totally free

## Direct Connect

The `Direct Connect` feature in the Gayaan app allows users to initiate a conversation with a potential match directly from the matching screen. Here's how it works, including information about the cost and availability under a premium subscription plan:

**Initiating a Direct Connect:**

Users browse through potential matches on the app and come across a profile that interests them.
When they want to start a conversation with that match, they can click the "Message" or "Connect" button on the matching screen.


**Cost for Direct Connect:**

Normally, using the "Direct Connect" feature incurs a cost of 50 Points per connection. This means that each time a user decides to initiate a conversation with a match using this feature, they spend 50 Points from their account.



**Points System:**

The app may have a points system where users can purchase points or earn through referring friends.

**Premium Subscription Plan:**

If the user is subscribed to a premium plan (e.g. subscription), they may enjoy the benefit of unlimited `Direct Connects` during the duration of their subscription.

This means that premium plan subscribers do not have to spend 50 Points for each connection. Instead, they can initiate as many conversations as they wish without additional charges.
