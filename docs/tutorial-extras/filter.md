# Filter Page

**Age Range Filter:**

- When users set their preferred age range by specifying a minimum and maximum age and then apply the filter, the matching algorithm will reevaluate the user's potential matches based on this new age range.
- It will filter out profiles that do not fall within the specified age range.
Profiles of users whose age falls within the selected range will be included in the updated search results.


**Location Filter:**

- When users limit their search results by selecting a specific country and then apply the filter, the algorithm will focus on profiles that match this location preference.
It will exclude profiles of users located in other countries, ensuring that the search results only include profiles from the selected country.


**Advanced Filters (Interests, Hobbies, Height, etc.):**

- When users apply advanced filters such as interests, hobbies, and height preferences, the algorithm will consider these additional criteria in the matching process.
