# Performance & Optimization


## The infrustructure

Gayaan App needs the following principles;

**Scalability:** Gayaan App needs to handle an increasing user base and data volume as it grows, requiring a scalable infrastructure and architecture.

**Reliability:** To meet Gayaan's users' expectations, the app must be highly reliable, minimizing downtime and ensuring consistent performance.

**Efficiency:** Gayaan App should optimize resource utilization and code execution to deliver efficient performance while conserving resources.

**Security:** Given the sensitivity of user data, robust security measures are essential to protect against breaches and safeguard Gayaan App's integrity.


**Caching:** Implementing caching mechanisms can enhance Gayaan App's speed and responsiveness, especially for frequently accessed content.

**Load Testing:** Regular load and stress testing ensure that Gayaan App can handle peak traffic without performance degradation.

**Scalable Architecture:** Designing the app with scalability in mind, such as adopting microservices or serverless architecture, ensures Gayaan can grow seamlessly.


:::note Photo Optimization

Gayaan App needs to utilize Content Delivery Networks (CDNs) to store photos of users for faster loading since it optimized by CDN provider. It's important to note that Gayaan does not render both the app and photos from the same Firebase server, ensuring optimal content delivery and improved performance.

## In the app, user experience


**Load the Matching Screen Effortlessly**

*How to Achieve This:*

When a user launches the app, our matching algorithms begin searching for suitable matches in the background. As soon as potential matches are found, a brief loading period occurs, after which the matching screen seamlessly opens.

This streamlined approach ensures that users can effortlessly explore all available matches without encountering loading delays. The same principle applies when users interact with the filter screen. After adjusting their filter settings, a loading process initiates, followed by the opening of the matching screen. Users can then smoothly navigate through available matches without the need for additional loading interruptions.
